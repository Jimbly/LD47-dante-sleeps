============================

Style:
  space ship, alien planets backgrounds
  avoid: rocks and other debris, aliens? dog-aliens? sputnik?
X Goal is to collect all rings
X Score is fewest number of hits?
X When all rings collected, stop flying in a loop and fly off into the sunset (zoom in or out?)
X backgrounds
title screen / high scores
particles:
  air pockets
  on hit
  on ring pickup
  behind plane - varying base on thrust
subtle indicator of current arc and thrust amount?
visible score is rings picked up minus hits? drop a ring upon hit

Biplane Loop
Art:
  Plane
  Things to avoid
  Things to collect
  Backgrounds, backgrounds, backgrounds
Gameplay:
  Pretty trivial core
  Points, levels, powerups? Time attack?
    High-score-able!

Other idea: Train Loop
Art:
  Train cars (need to look different) - too hard!
  ~10 faces (swappable parts?) + player + cops
Gameplay/animation:
  move around
  stab
  lights flicker
  progress towards finding all 5 demons
  cop arrest sequence
