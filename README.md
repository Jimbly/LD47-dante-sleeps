LD47 -
============================

background: fade colors, add stars, clouds (just crossfade?)
make bgs grayscale and tint in code
different color tint sets for each level
more detail on backgrounds
ambient wind sounds or music
try horizontally moving rings and rocks (variable speed)
final level set
cat on title screen
other things to avoid: other debris? aliens?
thicker rings?
? subtle indicator of current arc and thrust amount?

finalizing:
  wav -> mp3 conversion (and update ext_list)

Early Ideas
===========
Biplane Loop
Art:
  Plane
  Things to avoid
  Things to collect
  Backgrounds, backgrounds, backgrounds
Gameplay:
  Pretty trivial core
  Points, levels, powerups? Time attack?
    High-score-able!

Other idea: Train Loop
Art:
  Train cars (need to look different) - too hard!
  ~10 faces (swappable parts?) + player + cops
Gameplay/animation:
  move around
  stab
  lights flicker
  progress towards finding all 5 demons
  cop arrest sequence
