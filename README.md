Dante Slumbers - LD47 - Stuck in a loop
============================

Ludum Dare 47 Entry by Jimbly - "Dante Slumbers"

> Your cat fell asleep on the yoke, and you do not wish to wake him, so you're going to get through this using just the throttle.

* Using [Javascript libGlov/GLOV.js framework](https://github.com/Jimbly/glovjs)

Start with: `npm start` (after running `npm i` once)

Remaining TODO:
* Nothing! How is that possible?

Early Ideas
===========
Biplane Loop
Art:
  Plane
  Things to avoid
  Things to collect
  Backgrounds, backgrounds, backgrounds
Gameplay:
  Pretty trivial core
  Points, levels, powerups? Time attack?
    High-score-able!

Other idea: Train Loop
Art:
  Train cars (need to look different) - too hard!
  ~10 faces (swappable parts?) + player + cops
Gameplay/animation:
  move around
  stab
  lights flicker
  progress towards finding all 5 demons
  cop arrest sequence
