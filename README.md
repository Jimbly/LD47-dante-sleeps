============================

avoid: other debris? aliens?
? subtle indicator of current arc and thrust amount?
background: fade colors, add stars (just crossfade?)
sound effects
  X thrust: low/med/high
  X pick up ring
  X crash
  win - needs longer fanfare
new button graphic
ambient wind sounds or music
final level set
more detail on backgrounds

finalizing:

Early Ideas
===========
Biplane Loop
Art:
  Plane
  Things to avoid
  Things to collect
  Backgrounds, backgrounds, backgrounds
Gameplay:
  Pretty trivial core
  Points, levels, powerups? Time attack?
    High-score-able!

Other idea: Train Loop
Art:
  Train cars (need to look different) - too hard!
  ~10 faces (swappable parts?) + player + cops
Gameplay/animation:
  move around
  stab
  lights flicker
  progress towards finding all 5 demons
  cop arrest sequence
