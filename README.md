Dante Sleeps - LD47 - Stuck in a loop
============================

ambient wind sounds or music
  occasional cat meow / purr?
touch up plane
fix air drafts not disappearing during win anim

finalizing:
  wav -> mp3 conversion (and update ext_list)

Early Ideas
===========
Biplane Loop
Art:
  Plane
  Things to avoid
  Things to collect
  Backgrounds, backgrounds, backgrounds
Gameplay:
  Pretty trivial core
  Points, levels, powerups? Time attack?
    High-score-able!

Other idea: Train Loop
Art:
  Train cars (need to look different) - too hard!
  ~10 faces (swappable parts?) + player + cops
Gameplay/animation:
  move around
  stab
  lights flicker
  progress towards finding all 5 demons
  cop arrest sequence
